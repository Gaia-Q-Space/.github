#### Diagram Description

- **Alice (Sender):** Generates random bits and polarization bases.
- **Quantum Channel:** Sends quantum states (photons) to Bob.
- **Bob (Receiver):** Measures photons in randomly chosen bases.
- **Basis Sifting:** Alice and Bob compare their bases over a classical public channel.
- **Error Correction:** Remove errors and detect possible eavesdropping.
- **Final Key Generation:** Only matching bits (after error correction) become the shared secret key.
- **DIKE Traceability:** Every protocol phase is semantically logged and mapped per DIKE-class audit requirements.
