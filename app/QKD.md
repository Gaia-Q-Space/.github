#### **Diagram Description**

* **Alice (Sender):** Generates random bits and polarization bases
* **Quantum Channel:** Sends quantum states (photons)
* **Bob (Receiver):** Measures photons in random bases
* **Basis Sifting:** Alice and Bob compare bases over a classical public channel
* **Error Correction:** Remove errors and eavesdropping effects
* **Final Key Generation:** Only matching bits (post-error-correction) become the shared secret key
* **DIKE Traceability:** All protocol steps are semantically logged and mapped per DIKE-class rules
